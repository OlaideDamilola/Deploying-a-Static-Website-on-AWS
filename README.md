## Project Objectives:
- Host a static website using Amazon S3.
- Implement data protection measures to prevent accidental data loss.
- Define a data lifecycle strategy to optimize costs and manage object versions effectively.
- Enable disaster recovery capabilities by implementing cross-Region replication for data backup.

## Project Tasks and Steps:

### Task 1: Extracting Necessary Files
- Download the required files for the static website from Amazon S3.
- Extract the files locally, including index.html, CSS, and image folders.

### Task 2: Creating an S3 Bucket for Website Hosting
- Access the Amazon S3 console.
- Create an S3 bucket to host the static website.
- Configure static website hosting and specify the index.html file as the index document.

### Task 3: Uploading Website Content
- Upload the index.html file along with CSS and image folders to the S3 bucket.
- Verify website accessibility by opening the endpoint link in a web browser.

### Task 4: Creating Bucket Policy for Public Access
- Configure a bucket policy granting public read-only access to objects in the S3 bucket.
- Confirm that the café website is publicly accessible.

### Task 5: Enabling Versioning for Data Protection
- Enable versioning on the S3 bucket to protect against accidental data overwrite or deletion.
- Modify the index.html file and upload the updated version to verify versioning functionality.
- Confirm changes and view object versions in the S3 bucket.

### Task 6: Setting Lifecycle Policies for Cost Optimization
- Define lifecycle policies to transition older object versions to S3 Standard-IA after 30 days and delete versions after 365 days.
- Configure separate rules for lifecycle management to optimize storage costs.

### Task 7: Enabling Cross-Region Replication for Disaster Recovery
- Create a destination S3 bucket in a different AWS Region.
- Enable versioning on the destination bucket.
- Set up cross-Region replication from the source bucket to the destination bucket.
- Verify replication functionality and disaster recovery capabilities.

## Project Outcome:
- Successfully created and hosted a static website for the café using Amazon S3.
- Implemented data protection measures such as versioning and bucket policies.
- Defined a data lifecycle strategy to optimize storage costs and manage object versions efficiently.
- Enabled disaster recovery capabilities through cross-Region replication for data backup.

## Conclusion:
The Café Static Website Creation significantly enhances the café's online presence and data management practices. By leveraging Amazon S3 and implementing best practices for data protection and disaster recovery, the café ensures resilience, scalability, and cost-effectiveness in its web hosting infrastructure.

## Additional Notes:
- Regular monitoring and maintenance of the S3 buckets are essential to ensure data integrity and compliance.
- Periodic review of lifecycle policies and replication configurations helps optimize resource utilization and adapt to evolving business requirements.
